        <h3>Solar System
            <h4>The Solar System describes the Sun, the Planets, Comets, Asteroids and Meteoroids, Moons and all other bodies in the solar system. There are 166 known moons, 3 dwarf planets like ceres, aris and pluto. In solar system, not only staurn has rings but Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune have also rings. The solar system is divided into to two parts - the inner planets and the outer planets. The inner planets includes Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars and the outer planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.</h4>

            <h3>The Sun
                <h4 id="sun1">The Sun's position in the solar system is the center of solar system. The sun yellow dwarf star shinning for 5 billion years. The Sun gigantic ball of burning gas, includes hydrogen and hellium gas. It completes it's rotation on it's axis in 27 days. The Sun is not same color all over. Some areas of it's surface are darker. These spots are little pockets that are slightly cooler. Of course, sunspots are only 'little' compared to the Sun and some as bigger as large as Jupiter, The biggest planet in the solar system. The outer layer of the Sun is 6000°C hot, The outer core is 1,000,000°C hot and the inner core is 14,000,000°C hot.</h4>

                <h3>Mercury
                    <h4 id="mercury2"> Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system. The Diameter of the mercury is 4878 km. It is the third size of the earth. The Mercury is the planet closest to the sun. Mercury zooms around the sun in just 88 days, at an incredible 1,73,000 kph. That makes it faster than any space rocket ever invented. Mercury has no moons. Mercury dosen't have any weather, because it has no air and hardly any atmosphere. That means there are no clouds sheild the surface of the planet from the baking-hot sun durin the day, or to keep it heat at night. There is no wind or rain on mercury, either.</h4>

                    <h3>Venus

                        <h4 id="venus2">Venus is the 2nd nearest planet from the sun. the distance from sun of venus is 108 million km. It is the 6th biggest planet in the solar sytem. The diameter of the Venus is 12104 km. It is the hottest planet in the solar system. It is also called the morning star and evening star because it is so bright that we can see in night sky. Venus is named after a goddess. Venus was the name of the roman goddess of love and beauty-just right for the planet, which many people think it is the most beautiful object in the sky. Venus is a fraction smaller than the earth, but not by much.</h4>

                        <h3>Earth
                            <h4 id="erath2">Earth is the 3rd nearest planet to the sun. The distance form the sun is 150 million km. It is the 5th biggest planet in the solar system. The diameter of the earth is 12756 km. The earth has one moon. The earth is also called blue planet, because of water of seas and oceans. The 70% part of the earth is covered with water. The earth is magenatic. At the center of the earth, is a core of a molten metal called iron, which makes our planet like a giant magenet. This is what pulls the needle on the compass towards the magenatic north pole. The Earth has 4 layers, they are Crust the coldest part in the earth where we are living, mantle the layer where we can find valcanoes, Outer core and inner core the hottest layer where we can found metals. When earth first formed it was extremely hot and there was no oxygen. Over millions of years, the planet cooled, oceans formed and oxygen was made. The first life on the earth apperared about 3 billion years ago.</h4>

                            <h3>Mars
                                <h4 id="mars"> Mars is the 4th nearest planet from the sun. The diameter of the mars is 6796 km. It has 2 moons deimos and phobos, but they are not round like our moon. They look more like baked potatoes! They might have been asteroids that mars captured with it's gravity. The distance from the sun is 228 million km. It is also called the red planet. There's a record breaking valcanos on mars. olympus mons is about 600 km across and towers over 25 km high. It's the solar system's biggest volcano. Long ago, it spurted out runny rivers of black lava.</h4>

                                    <h3>Asteroids, Meteoroids and Comet
                                        <h4 id="arsteroidam2">Asteroids are found between inner Planets and Outer Planets (Between Mars & Jupiter). Asteroids are also called 'Space Rocks'. Scientists think that Astroids are pieces of the material that formed the Solar System, or Planetesimals. Asteroids mean 'The pieces failed to stick together to form a Planet'. Asteroids do not weigh the same as the Earth. Even if all of the Asteroids in the Solar System were lumped together, the Earth would still weigh more than a thousand times as much. There are lots of minor planets, known as Asteroids, in our Solar System. About 3,500 of these lumps of space rock are orbiting the Sun. An Astroid is a rocky body. Astroids range in size from objects several 100 kms in diameter to dust particles. The largest Astroid is 'Ceres'. The diameter of the ceres is 950 km
                                            Meteoroid describes a Meteor or a Meteorite while it is still outside the Earth atmosphere. All Meteoroids are made of matter left over from the begining of the Solar System or they are part of the tail of the Comets. A Meteoroid is smaller in size as cpmpare to an Asteroids. A shooting star or Meteor happens when a tiny space rock, called a Meteoroid, enters Earth's atmosphere and burns up.
                                            A Comet is a minor member of the Solar System. Comets are balls of ice and rocks. Most Comets have three parts viz., the nucleus, coma and tails. The gas and dust tails point away from the Sun. As Comet gets closer to the Sun, it gets hotter and its tail becomes longer. Comets called Short period or Long period, depending on how long they take to go one round the Sun. Comets are differentiated from Astroids by the presence of a tail. Some comets even grow a second tail. The best known short period comet is HALLEY's Comet and it will be seen in 2061 again.

                                                <h4 id="Jupiter2">Jupiter is the 5th nearest planet in the solar system. It is also the biggest planet in the solar system. The diameter of the jupiter is 142984 km. It has 79 known moons. The biggest moon of Jupiter in solar system is Ganymede. The other moons are Callisto, Europa and Lo. The Callist is the most createred world in the solar system. Almost every bit of this moon is covered with craters. The Valhalla crater is the biggest crater about 300 km across. It is called valhalla after place where the vikings thought brave warriors went when they die. The distance of the jupiter from the sun is 778 million km. The jupiter has a storm named the great red spot on it srface where the storm is blowing for millions of years and it is about 40,000 km across and you could fit two earths in it to cover it. the jupiter is stripy planet. It looks like it's wearing a giant pair of pyjamas, because of it's bands of clouds. They're frozen crystals of water, ammonia and other chemicals. It has two layers of gases and core. Jupiter has also rings like Saturn and Jupiter situates in outer planets.</h4>

The diameter of the Saturn is 129660 km. It has 62 known moons. The distance from the sun is 1427 million km. The biggest moon of saturn is Titan. Titan is the second largest moon of the solar system after Ganymede. Titan is covered with clouds so we can't see it's surface. The saturn is also called ring planet. You could fit 740 earths into the saturn to fill it and it is the second biggest planet in the solar system after Jupiter. Its rings are 270,000 km acros. It's rings are about twice width of the planet. Saturn is made of liquid and gas, with a small rocky center. It is so light that, if there was the ocean big enough the planet would float like boat.</h4>

The diameter of the uranus is 51118 km. Uranus has 17 known moons. The distance from the sun is 2870 million km. The bluish-green is the color of methane, a stinky gas that makes up part of Uranus's atmosphere. The other gases in the air are hydrogen and helium - The gas we use to fill party balloons. The uranus was nearly called george, because when herchel discovered the new planet, he wanted to name it after the english king at the time. George III. In the end, it was called Uranus, after the greek god of sky. The poles on the uranus are warmer than the equator. Because Uranus is tilted on it's side. The poles are the warmest place on the planet. Summer at the south pole last 42 years! Uranus was discovered in 1781. The man who found it William Herchel, was not expecting to find a planet at all.</h4>

The diameter of neptune is 49532 km. The distance from the sun 4497 million km. Neptune has 14 known moons. The main ones are Triton and Nereid. The Triton is biggest moon. It is 2706 km across about four-fiffths the size of our moon. Triton is one of the coldest placees ever recorded! The temperature on the ice covered moon minus 236°C. That just 37°C away from being the lowest possible temperature in the entire Universe! When the gas nitrogen freezes, it looks like pink snow! There is frozen nitrogen at neptune's north and south poles, and at the poles of it's largest moon, Triton. So far from the sun, Neptune and its moons are bitterly cold places. The astronomers knew Neptune must be there before they saw it! They could tell something big was pulling Uranus and they were able to predict exactly where Neptune was almost 4.5 million km away from the sun.</h4>

The distance from the sun is 5900 mn km. Pluto was the name of the Greek God of the underworld. Also, the first two letters of the Pluto, 'P' and 'L' are the initials of Percival Lowell, who first predicated the planet beyond Neptune. Pluto is the coldest dwarf planet of Galaxy which is not surprising, because it is usually the farthest from the Sun and its surface is -220°C cold. Inside, it is made up of ice and rock, and the dwarf planet has a thick layer of ice over the Top. Pluto is smaller than a USA or Russia having 2360 km. Pluto takes 248 years just to orbit the Sun ones! But Pluto's orbit is funny shape. For 20 years of its orbit, Pluto dips in closer to the Sun than Neptune when this happens Neptune becomes the farthest planet in the Solar System. On Febuary 4, 2020, scientists announced about 'Pluto's Heart' called 'TOMBAUGH REGIO' and which is a vast plain on the planet covered with Nitrogen ice. Pluto's renowned Nitrogen heart rules its atmospheric circulation causes wind to blow.<br><br>

It is similar to the asteroid belt, but is far larger – 20 times as wide and 20–200 times as massive. Like the asteroid belt, it consists mainly of small bodies or remnants from when the Solar System formed. While many asteroids are composed primarily of rock and metal, most Kuiper belt objects are composed largely of frozen volatiles (termed "ices"), such as methane, ammonia and water. The Kuiper belt is home to three officially recognized dwarf planets: Pluto, Haumea and Makemake. Some of the Solar System's moons, such as Neptune's Triton and Saturn's Phoebe, may have originated in the region. The Kuiper belt was named after Dutch-American astronomer Gerard Kuiper. The Kuiper belt is distinct from the theoretical Oort cloud, which is a thousand times more distant and is mostly spherical. The objects within the Kuiper belt, together with the members of the scattered disc and any potential Hills cloud or Oort cloud objects, are collectively referred to as trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs).</h4>

The gravity is so strong because matter has being squeezed into atiny space. These can happen when a star is dying. Because no light can get out, people cannot see black holes. They are invisible. Black holes can be big or small. The largest black holes are called "Supermassive" is located at the center of the milky way galaxy called Sagittarius A. Another kind of black hole is called "Stellar" That made when the center of a very big star falls in upon itself or collapses, When this happens, it causes a supernova that is an exploding star that blasts part of the star into space. Scientists think that in the last moments befor you disappeared forewer into black hole, the force of gravity would stretch you until it pulled you apart. They call this being 'SPAGTHETTIFIED'. dark matter is what scientists call all the stuff in the universe that they know is there but can not find! they think it might be made of ghostly little particles called 'NEUTRINOS'.</h4>

The gases in a nabula gradually gather together into spining balls. They spin more and more quickly until they get amazingly hot and a big blast, called a nuclear reaction, begins. When this happens a baby star begins to glow. Stars are mostly made off gases, hydrogen and helium. Helium is the gas used to fill party balloons. There are lots of layers inside a star, with gases moving around in each one. Everything in the space including you, is made out of elements, such as carbon and silicon. All of these were cooked up in stars, which formed from the first matter in the Universe. Our star, the sun, is all alone, but some stars, called binary stars, are in pairs. They seem to spin around each other. Very close pairs do one turn of this 'Dance' in just hours. White giants are really huge, hot stars that appear to be white. They can be 20 times bigger tahn our sun. Rigel is a white giant shining about 60,000 times more brightly than our sun. Small Stars are called 'Dwarfs' and big stars are called 'Giants'. Stars hotter than our Sun often shine a bright pale blue, while other stars can sometimes appear red or white. Only a few are yellow.

But the Galaxy is just one of many millions of similar giant groups of stars, also called galaxies (with a small ‘g’), scattered throughout the Universe. Our Galaxy is about 13 billion years old. Name of the neighbor Galaxy is ANDROMEDA. Spiral Galaxies are spinning, Catherine wheel shaped galaxies like the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies. They have a dense core of stars, surrounded by long whirling arms. Barred spiral galaxies are variations on spiral galaxies with a central bar from which arms of stars trail like water from a spinning garden sprinkler. Elliptical galaxies are huge egg-shaped galaxies sometime containing a trillion stars. They are the oldest galaxies of all, some over 12 billion years old. Irregular galaxies are different from the others in that they have no obvious shape at all, and may have formed from the debris of colliding galaxies.</h4>
